## Features

- **Multi-PDF Upload:** Upload and process multiple PDF files simultaneously.
- **Text Processing:** Extract and split text into chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Storage:** Use FAISS to store and retrieve text embeddings.
- **Question Answering:** Chat with the AI by asking questions based on the uploaded PDFs.
- **Google Generative AI Integration:** Uses Google's Gemini Pro for advanced question-answering capabilities.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.
